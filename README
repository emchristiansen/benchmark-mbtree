PRE-ALPHA CODE: BEWARE

Author: Eric Christiansen
Contributor: Iljung Sam Kwak

This benchmarks the library at

https://github.com/emchristiansen/mbtree

It compares brute force search to the metric tree technique used in the above library. It measures wall time as well as the number of metric lookups required by each technique. It uses several real datasets from the UC Irvine machine learning database.

Note it runs just one test at a time; modify benchmark.scala to change the test.
